Java Packages for Implementing Your Programs
This GitHub repository contains several Java packages that you can use to implement your programs.


These packages include:

LCM.Lcmpack: 
This package allows you to find lcm of n numbers in your program.

Factorialpack.factorial: 
This package allows you to find factorial of any number.

Fibbonaci.Fibonaccipack: 
This package allows you to to display fibonacci series upto n numbers.

Prime.Primepack: 
This package allows use to find the if the number is or not.

More packages Including soon.....
Star my Reprository soon will add master Package..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To use any of these packages in your program,you need to move the package file to the parent directory,then you can simply import the desired package and instantiate the classes as needed.

For example, to use the "Factorialpack.factorial" package, you can add the following import statement to the top of your Java file:

  // import Factorialpack.factorial;

Then you need to create object with name as you wish:

 //  factorial f = new factorial();

Then just pass the values it will work:

 //  System.out.println("enter the Number");
        int num= sc.nextInt();
	 int fac=f.fac(num);
        System.out.println("\n The FActorial ="+fac);


yesss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You learned how to use them--------------------------------------------

Still Confused I have Also Included a sample program where you will understand all packages work.
